    <h1>RACISM</h1>
    <h2><em>-our advocacy-</em></h2>
    <p>
        Ending racism doesnâ€™t only mean stopping the use of hurtful words and actions towards people. It is also about understanding and embracing other people and their culture.
		It requires us to look beyond the surface and challenge the assumptions and prejudices that we may have inherited or learned over time.
    </p>
    <p>
		It means listening, learning, and stepping into the shoes of others to truly understand their experiences.
		We must also hold ourselves accountable for the systems that perpetuate inequality and take action to dismantle those structures.
